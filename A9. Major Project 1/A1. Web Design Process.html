Till now we had to replacate the website, that this is the website and you have to replicate it.
But there will be times where you'll have to developer your own website.

Web Design Process
1. Setting Goals and Targets: you should set your goals and targets you should understand what you have to create then you can say that yeah this is my goal and this should be the target to achieve than end goal.
   for eg. if you want to create a shopping website, then you should focus that these many products are going to be there and user will be able to come and place order, view, return and all those things
so once you have rought idea in mind next thing will be to lay it down more clearly
2 Figure out what to implement: eg, as I have to develope a shopping website and now lets talk more precisely and talk in terms of features
  i) Features: the features I want to work on, in case of shopping website user should be able to purchase a product, view a product, write a review ets:
  ii) Screens: so these many features I want to provide then what should be the screens eg, first home screen where user can see popular/trending products and based on your search history. then there will be others pages as well like for putting reviews etc
3. Next is the design part of it: If I have a page or a homepage then what things should be there on homepage, design means not colors, it meant the elements we have to put.
  so whenever you are creating a design 2 important thing you should takecare of from the design perspective is breakpoints and wireframes
  i) Breakpoints
  ii) Wireframs
      -> Low Fidelity
      -> High Fidelity
4. Developement: the last step is to write code

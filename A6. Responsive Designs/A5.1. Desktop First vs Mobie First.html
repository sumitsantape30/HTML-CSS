Popular design aprroaches to come up with responsive designs are i) Desktop First  ii)Mobile First
their names indicates what we want to achieve by using them.

Desktop First simply means that when you are thinking how that design is going to look on desktop. So i'm starting with the desktop version in my mind then moving on the ipad version and then moving on the mobile version. 
Mobile first is opposite of that it simply it focuses that while you are creating a design of your website then your focus should be that how your website is going to look on mobile. Mobile view should be the first priority. so first we will think about mobile. we'll think if website had to look on mobile device How will it look? then we will move to the next big screen and then we'll come to the desktop version of it.

If you feel that people will visit your site more by desktop then desktop first will make more sense and if you feel that people will visit more via movbile then mobile first make sense.
The design thst we did in previous code we did it keeping in my mind  the desktop first view now lets do it other way.

lets design the same thing keeping in mind mobile first idea.

			Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original author, modifications and authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.

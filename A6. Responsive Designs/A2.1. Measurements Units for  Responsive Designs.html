there is not single technique that we can follow in order to achieve a responsive design but there are bunch of things that we should know write set of measurements units to use and we should also be aware of media queries when and how to use them.
so first step towards creating responsive designs is is using the right set if measurement units.

There are two categories of measurment unit and they were absolute and relative units.

Absolute units are: px, inches, centimeter , mililiter etc.
Relative units are: % percentages, vh, vw, rem, em. (rem and are generally used while dealing with the font sizes  or text part) (and %, vh, vw are generally used in dimensions)

so lets revisit these units so that we can decide which unit to use and when.

			Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original author, modifications and authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.

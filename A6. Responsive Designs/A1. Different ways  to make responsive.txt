1. Responsive Web Design: you want that website should adjust itself according to the different screen size then you write CSS rule to control that.
2. Dynamic Serving: if you open the actual amazon website  on the mobile it will look different from the one you are seeing on desktop. 
server identifies which from which device the request is coming from and what files and what views do I have for that particular device so server will send only those files which are relavant to that device type.
but in Responsive Web Design the html/css code is same  whether you are opening it on mobile or desktop the code is same.

Problems with dynamic Serving: you have to maintain multiple files 

3. Separate mobile websites: so have a separate website with a different URL for a dedicately designed for mobile only. eg for facebook it is : m.facebook.com , m.youtube.com

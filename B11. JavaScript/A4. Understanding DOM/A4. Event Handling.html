    <!-- one way to do it is by using attribute. on<eventName> is the attribute-->
    <!-- <button id="bnt" onclick="alert('Hello')"> Say Hello!</button> -->
    <button id="btn"> Say Hello!</button>
    
    <!-- next option is to add event listeners to the element that you want to handle -->

        // we have the button now we need to add event listener to this button
        //addEventListener needs 2 arguments, first is the event that you want to handle and next is the function that you want to perfom or the action you want to perform.
        helloButton.addEventListener('click', function (){// click is the event that I want to handle, and handler will be the function which will have the desired code
            alert('Hello');
        } );   // I can create a function inside or I can create a function pass

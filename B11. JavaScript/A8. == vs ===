So JS does automatic type conversion.
1 + '1' = '11' // 1 is number and '1' is string, so number will be converted to string and they will be concantenated.
1 - '1' = 0 //so string will be converted to the number and then the result will be the number.
1 * '1' = 1
so there is this automatic type conversions that takes place and we call it type coercion.
so these type conversions actually take place in equality operator as well.

1 == 1
true
1 == '1'  // so there will be type conversion taking place here, Stirng will be converted to number and then they will be compared.
true

1 !='1'
false
 
// there was a need that programers should be able to compare based on the types of value as well so which is why === or unity operator was introduced.
so this operator will compare based on a type as well.
1==='1'
false // so answer is false, 1 number should not be equal to string both are different so in this case answer is false. there will be no automatic type conversion/coercion will be taking place.

1 !== '1' // answers will be true coz they both are not equal, they have different types.
true

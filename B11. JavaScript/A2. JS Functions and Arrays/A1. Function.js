// In order to create a function write function keyword and then write function name and then curly brackets to indicate start and end of the function
function showAlert(){
    // so this function will show an alert
    alert("Hey!");
}

//next thing we have to do is call the function
// we use camel case while naming function, first letter will be small and then first letter of every word will be capital
showAlert();
// so this will show and alert msg
===================================================
  
// If I want to take the alert message from user
  
  function showAlert(msg){ //you dont need to put the integer type here, writing var wil through an error
 //The value that function receives is called are called parameters
    alert(msg);
}

showAlert("Hey"); //now while calling the function I'll pass the message I want to display
     // the value that we pass through the function while calling it re called argument

==========================================================
  
  // you can also create a function that takes more that one input as well

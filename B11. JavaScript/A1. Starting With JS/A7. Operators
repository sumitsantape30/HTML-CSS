i) Arithmatic Operators
10 + 2
12
13 / 2
6.5 // number can be decimal or integeral in jS, in  java since both 13 and 2 are integers answers will be integral but in JS will be numbers coz they are numbers here.

15.5 % 2 // this gives use remainder
1.5 

ii) Assignment Operators
var a = 10

//you can also combine above both the operators
var a = 10
a += 2
12

a *= 2
24

iii) Unary Operators, they take only single operand here
a++
24 // a is 25 but value that will be returned is 24
++a
26 // 25 incremented to 26

iv) Comparison Operator ( >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==, ===, !==)
the output of the comparison operator will always be boolean.

var b= 100
undefined
var b= 200
undefined
a==b
false

v) Logical Operators
(&&, ||)
(in && if first condition is false then it wont check the second condition and will return false, And in || if the first conditon is true then it wont check the 2dn condition coz its true anyways.)

a < 20 && b > 10
false
a < 20 || b > 10
true

a < 20 && b++ > 99
false // overall answer will be false because first condition is false and if I print b the value of b is 100 coz 2nd condition didnt run.

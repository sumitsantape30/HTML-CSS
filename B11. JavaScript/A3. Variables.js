JS is dynamic, you dont need to specify the variable type while intialising

var a= 10;

//we dont specify the type if the numberic value, as now a is holding the number 10 now I can make hold the string
a= "Sumit"
//I can also give it a boolean
a= true
// Adding semicolon after every statement in java script is optional.

The build in data values that we have, so there are 6 primitive values and there is 1 which is object.
In primitive values we have: i) Number (umber refers to both  integeral and decimal number)
ii) String  iii) Boolean iv) null v)undefined vi) Symbol

// to print the statement
var a= 10;
console.log(a)

//Infinity also refers to the values which are greater than the maximim value that can be stored in a number in a JS.

Math.pow(10, 2)
100
Math.pow(10, 100)
1e+100
Math.pow(10, 1000)
Infinity // now this is beyond what can be stored in a number in a JS so thats why answer will be infinity.

//What maximum number can be stored in JS, you can figured this out this way
Number.MAX_VALUE
1.7976931348623157e+308

//So after infinty next type of value is NaN, it refers to Not a Number 
Math.sqrt(-1) // Square root of negative number doesn not exist so it prints NaN
NaN

// so if you want to extract integer from the string, you can do that with the following way
parseInt("100")
100

//if you give the value which cannot be converted to an integer then it will give Nan
parseInt("Aaaaaaaa")
NaN

//so we have discussed that the type is associated with the value and not the varable, vriable holds value and that value had some type
// so if you want to know what is the type of value that variable is holding then that you can do using type of()

typeof 10
"number"

var a= 10 // you can do that this way as well, create a variable and then use typeof on that variable
undefined

 a= true
true
typeof a
"boolean"

var b // if I created a variable and did not assigned any value then chek its type it'll print undefined
typeof b
"undefined"

var a= null
undefined
typeof a
"object"  // it returns the type of null as object,  this is actually bug in the javasrcipt, type of null should be null but its object in this case

typeof Infinity
"number"

typeof NaN
"number" // the type of NaN is not a number but here it is so that how javascript is

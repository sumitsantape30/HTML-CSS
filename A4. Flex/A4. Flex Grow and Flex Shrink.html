full name for flex box is flexible boxes. We discussed flex, coz we can actually design the flex boxes such that elements within the flex are flexible enough to adjust themselves.
for e.g. if container has some space available then elements can grow to occupy that space or if container is short in size, it has to shrink then elements can shrink themselves accordingly to occupy whatever space they have so this flexibily is what flex offers us.

     <!-- there is front introduction section of the resume, this is actually the part of header -->
    <header>
        <!-- the header includes the navigation tags then there's name and then there is social media links 
            the social links and name are actually lists, you can think of them as lists but display property for list item is block so if I have to create a horizontal list I can use that display property here-->

    </header>

    <!-- post header next is the main section -->
    <main>
        <!-- now this main has multiple sections within it -->
         <!-- first is about section, then is skills then work experience then education, portfolio and then contact me section, so we need sections and we'll give them id's so that we can use them later. -->

        the image we saw is not part of header, it is part of about section
        <section id="about">
        </section>

        <section id="skills">

        </section>

        <section id="experience">

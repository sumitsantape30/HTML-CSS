this is decided based on the specificity of the selector

Order of preference:
1. Inline CSs 2.ID 3.Class 4.Type
if none of them are present it'll go with the default values

<body>

	<p> Paragraph - Type </p>
	<p class = "class-red"> Paragraph - Class </p>
   <!-- so there are two rules which are trying to apply to <p> tag, there's type selector which is general rule <p> tag should have and there's class selector according to which this <p> tag with this class should satisfy the rule. -->
  <!--  the color of the "Paragraph - Class" will become red that means if there's type selector and class selector, class selector wins, rule which is specified in class selector is applied -->

   <!-- let's introduce the id, para corresponding to the id -->
    <p id="para-id" class = "class-red"> Paragraph - ID </p>
   <!--  so here color will be purple means id selector wins, so the specificity sequence says if their is a id selector, id selector will get the preference, if id is not there and there's a class selector, class selector will get preference and if class selector is also not there, there's type selector we'll go back to type selector -->

   <!--  There's also other way to specify the styles and that is via the style attribute( inline CSS) -->
   <!-- let's add inline css corresponding to color only -->
   <p id="para-id" class = "class-red" style="color: cyan;"> Paragraph - ID </p>
   <!-- now this p tag has id, class, type and inline CSS as well -->
    <!-- So here inline CSS will get the higher preference -->

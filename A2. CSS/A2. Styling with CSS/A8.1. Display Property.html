<!-- Here we will be learning about CSS display property, we have already seen the display property before in HTML section, we sae inline and block.
Inline means they come along in the same one line they do not block the entire line. *see below code from span* -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="DisplayProperties.css">
</head>
<body>

    <!-- just for an example span is an inline element, in output Text1 and Text2 will be next to each other in the same line whereas block elements occupy the complete line -->
    <span> Text 1</span>
    <span> Text 2</span>

    <!-- block elements occput the complete line, *see CSS file after this code* -->
    <div id="div1"> abcd </div>
    <div id="div2"> defg </div>
</body>
</html>

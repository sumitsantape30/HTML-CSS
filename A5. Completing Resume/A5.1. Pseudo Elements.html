Pseudo classes are used along with the selectors they were used to select an element based on a specific state.
so pseudo elements help us to style an elements or can say style specific part of an element. for eg. if you have a paragraph and style the first letter of the paragraph or you want to style first line of the paragraph you can.
so psedo element gives us flexibility to do that.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>

    </title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Overflow_Wrap.css">

</head>
<body>


     <!-- <p class = "styled-first-letter">  learn about pseudo elements </p> I want to add this capitalize styled first letter only to some p tags and not all p tags 
	<p> learn about pseudo elements </p>  -->
    
    Now we have Heading
    <p> Heading </p>
</body>

    /*background-image: linear-gradient(red, cyan, blue );*/ /*you can have 3 colors as well*/
    /*background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue 40%);*/ /*you can actually add transition point where you want 1 color to start*/
    /*background-image: linear-gradient(red, cyan 50%, blue 120% );*/ /*can set percentage of individual colors as well, if you want to start color from particular px then you can put that in place of percentage*/
    
    /*if you want that direction of gradient should be towards right so I can set it as to right as well as to top. In fact you can combine as well to top right*/
    /*background: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);*/

    /*Instead of left right you can specify exact direction in degrees as well*/
    /*background-image: linear-gradient(-120deg, red, cyan, blue );*/
    /* so we learnt adding linear gradient, you need to add color stop, you can do that in perecentage or in absolute terms*/
    
    /*you can also set it to background only as well, its a shorthand property, we can set repeating gradient as well*/
    /*background: repeating-linear-gradient( red, blue 10px);*/ /*you can also set it to right, top right etc*/
   
    /*then we have radial gradient*/  
    background: radial-gradient(red, cyan, blue);

	<!-- 1.To make the sentence bold we can use <b> tag, and b is a inline tag means same line mai hi chalega nhito next word next mai aajata and sirf sample ne complete line ocupy karliya hota -->
    
    <!-- 2. For italic text I can do it using the <i> tag -->
    <!-- 3.you can also make bold and italic at the same time -->
   <!--  4.We have also another tage called strong. Strong and bold gives the same result but strong is used when we have something important to indicate. -->

    	<span>
        a <sup> 2 </sup>
        b <sub> 2 </sub>
        <br> <!-- to start the below text in the newline we used br tag -->
        <Q> Quoted Text </Q>
        </span>
    </p>

    <!-- 5. for subscript and superscript: Suppose I want to indicate formula  -->
    <!-- 6. if you want to add quoted text then we use <Q> tag for that -->
    <!-- The way we have div serving the purpose of a container lly we have span. The difference betn the span and div is that span is an inline tag. (It'll not start in newline and not occupy complete width), so for applying common formatting you can do that using span. -->

	<p> This is a  &nbsp; &nbsp; sample text. 
		&lt; p &gt; tag is used for paragraph ; 
		She&apos;s 
	</p>

	<!-- 1. If i want that there should be multiple spaces between 'a' and "sample" so adding actual spaces will not help, so to do that we need to use the special character call &nbsp (no break space), one &nbsp; == 1 space -->
    <!-- 2. It will asume that paragraph of first line is completed and new para has been started from the second line but actually i want to write down that angular bracket p is used for paragraphs in order to do that we need to use the symbol seperately, i'll use &lt; instead of < and &gt; instead of > we'll be able to see <p> printed in the output -->
    <!-- 3. for apostrophe we have &apos -->

	<h2> Heading 1 </h2>
	<h2> Heading 2 </h2>
	<!-- the h tags <h2> tags that we used are of Block type. Block means that they start in new line -->
	<!-- In output "Heading 1" is not occupying the complete width of line but it still blocking the complete line and next 
	"Heading 2" is beginning from the next line and it is also occupying the complete width available -->
    <!-- so block HTML tags always start in new line and they occupy the complete width avaible in that line -->

    <p> This is paragraph </p> <!-- this sentence will start from new line means it is a block tag -->

    <!-- Inline tags are those that don't start in a new line and they take as much as space they require for their content and they don't block the complete line -->

    <!-- In the output these both of the images will appear next to each other, it didn't print in the newline -->
     <!--  They unnecessarily don't start in a new line when there is space in the same line, also don't block the complete line --> 

     <!-- but if i enclose one image in a <div> now image will appear in new line that means <div> is a block type of html element that means it occupies the complete line and starts in the new line -->

   <!--  heading, paragraph, div etc are block elements
    whereas  image, anchor is an inline element -->

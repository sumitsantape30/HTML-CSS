its time to deep dive into bootstrap, its time to understand what different classes are available to us, what are differetn features that we can use while designing.
checkout the official bootstrap website- getbootstrap.com

the display property, one way to set it is write directly in css and set the display property. other way is you can use bootstrap classes to get that done.
the different values we have for display property are:
none
inline
inline-block
block
grid
table
table-cell
table-row
flex
inline-flex

Now how can we set display property ? Everything in bootstrap works with classes, while adding relevant classes.
   d is the suffix which you have to use  and then hiphen(-) and then the property, if i want to set the property to block then I can write something like this "d-block" now this will apply to all the breakpoints xs onwards coz default value is xs.
you can use breakpoints are well to do that: suppose i want display to be block but on medium screens and above I want the display of that element to be inline block so if I want to do that then "d-block 
d-md-block" to set the display values of medium and above.

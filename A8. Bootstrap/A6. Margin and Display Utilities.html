its time to deep dive into bootstrap, its time to understand what different classes are available to us, what are differetn features that we can use while designing.
checkout the official bootstrap website- getbootstrap.com

the display property, one way to set it is write directly in css and set the display property. other way is you can use bootstrap classes to get that done.
the different values we have for display property are:
none
inline
inline-block
block
grid
table
table-cell
table-row
flex
inline-flex

Now how can we set display property ? Everything in bootstrap works with classes, while adding relevant classes.
   d is the suffix which you have to use  and then hiphen(-) and then the property, if i want to set the property to block then I can write something like this "d-block" now this will apply to all the breakpoints xs onwards coz default value is xs.
you can use breakpoints are well to do that: suppose i want display to be block but on medium screens and above I want the display of that element to be inline block so if I want to do that then 
class="d-block d-md-block" to set the display values of medium and above.

			<!-- 1. I have this element here I dont want this element to be on medium screens and above this element is only meant to be displayed on a small screen so I can set its display as none as soon as you reach the breakpoint of the medium screens -->
			<!-- <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-2 d-md-none" style="background-color: red;
			height: 60px;"> --> <!-- now the red element is gone actually so now if you decrease the screen size small the red element will be back in the picture but when size is medium and above this red element wont be there -->
			<!-- </div> --> 
			<!-- isko comment karlo -->

			<!--2. if I want the red div to be visible on xs and sm, and I want it to be invisible on md devices and I want this elment to be visible again on large(lg) and extra large(xl) devices so what are the relevant classes that I should add to this div? so coz we wanted to be visible in xs and sm you dont have to do anything by default its block and its visible but I want that on md it should be visible and I want it to be visible on large devices as well then I can add d-lg-block -->
			<!-- <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-2 d-md-none d-lg-block" style="background-color: red;
			height: 60px;"> --> <!-- so on medium it'll be gone so you just have to use relevant classes to get the result -->

			<!-- 3. Next thing is margin and padding for an element, in property you put whether you have to se margin or padding and in sizes you put whether you want to apply margin on all sides or you want to apply margin only on top so for top you can write m-t  -->

		<!-- 5. so you can specify width in terms of column now by default whatever column/class you are specifying here are for xs, but whatever rule you are applying for xs is actually applicable to all screen beyond that as well. so if you have only specified rule for xs, that will be applied to xs and for all other breakpoints beyond xs as well -->
		<!-- so if I want that this element(red wala) should occupy 6 columns on a xs screen but on a small screen this should occupy only 4 columns coz now I have more space so in order to do that specify a rule like class="col-6 col-sm-4" so on a small screen this will occupy 4 columns width and col-6 that we wrote it will be for xs so these are the rules--> 
		<!-- and the rules for the screens above this "col-sm-4" this rule will be applicable, these rule is for all the devices which has small screens and above be it medium be it large be it extra large. if you want on a large screen this should occupy only 2 then you can convey this way class="col-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-2"  --> 
		<!-- you can write col-6 or col-xs-6 as well -->
		<!-- so the rule is col-xx(xx is breakpoint)-number of columns(how wide is it going to be)  -->

		<!-- 4. you can also add other div as well in the container -->
		<!-- <div class="row" style="background-color: blue"> 
			<div class="col-6" style="background-color: red;
			height: 60px;">

lets create layout using bootstrap. whie creating layouts grid system is something you should know about. 
Grid system consist of container, these containers will have rows within them and these rows will have columns within them.
so every grid in bootstrap is actually a 12 column grid. so if you want to place an element in a row then you can specify its positon and its width in terms of columns.
suppose I want it to occupy  25% of the area then out of 12 25% means 3 columns.

	<!-- So i have added some of the links to use the bootstrap now I want to have a container, then that container will have row within it and row will have column -->
	<!-- topmost div should be container so giving it a class as container -->
	<div class="container"> <!-- if you use container-fluid then it will occupy the complete width -->
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col" style="background-color: red;
			height: 60px;"> <!-- here we have not specified how wide this element is going to be by default it is taking the complete width available means it is 12column wide -->

			</div>

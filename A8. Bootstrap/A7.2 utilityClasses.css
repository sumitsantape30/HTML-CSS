/*all border dark classes*/
.border-dark{
	border-width: 4px !important; /*I want border width to be 4px*/
} /*but this rule is not able to override .border rule( inspect and see) coz this rule is important so to override that important we should mark this as !important*/
/*so after refreshing you can see that border rule is applied*/

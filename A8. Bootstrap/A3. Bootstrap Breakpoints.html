Breakpoint is a point where a design change will trigger, for eg If I am creating a design for a mobile device where I have different divs and now user opens it on a ipad, I have wider screen now divs will become horizontal so this the point where chnge in design is taking place so that will be my breakpoint.
lly if you are using bootstrap is designed keeping in mind responsiveness factor and is designed in mobile first paradigm.
Mobile first means whater designs we are creating are created in mind a mobile device that this is how my wesite should look on a mobile device.  So now if the screen is getting wider then what change should I make to that design is what we should know.
when and what changes should be made is what you have to take care of. so there are different breakpoints in bootstrap which might you want to use in case you want to create a generic design and a responsive design.

so lets discuss about different breakpoints.
i) xs - This is for extra small devices that means mobile devices generally in portrait mode. so all the device where screen length is less than 576px that is XS.
ii) (sm) Small Devices - generally mobile devices in a andscape mode where max length is less that <768px
iii) (md) medium devices - ipads generally and its length ranges from 768 to less than 992 or I can say 768px onwards
iv) (lg) large devices - screen rang is 999 to onwards
v) (xl) Extra large- 1200px onwards 
so these are different breakpoint so while using different classes in bootstrap, whatater design or rules you have to write in bootstrap we'll be doing with the help of relavnt classes.
so while creating classes we'll have to be careful about what breakpoint.
 Dont remeber these values just be aware of the terms.
  you have flexibilty to change these breakpoints
